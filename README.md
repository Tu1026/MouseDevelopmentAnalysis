# Mouse_dev_transcriptome
An transcriptomic analyiss of bulk RNA seq from different tissues in embryonic mice in different time points. All analysis are done in R, there are 4 R markdown notebooks and one google slides for the presentation. 

Check the r notebooks:
(On TF genes only)
[The first part of anaylsis (mostly distribution less specific)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tu1026/MouseDevelopmentAnalysis/main/Main/TFOnlyExploration.html)
[The second part of analysis (Differentia expression analysis, set anaylsis, correlation, PCA)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tu1026/MouseDevelopmentAnalysis/main/Main/TFOnlyExploration2.html)


(All protein coding genes)
[The first part of rough work (mostly distribution less specific)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tu1026/MouseDevelopmentAnalysis/main/Main/Exploration.html)
